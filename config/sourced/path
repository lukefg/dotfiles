# Some notes on PATH:
# Order of operations
# .zshenv → .zprofile → .zshrc → .zlogin → .zlogout
# First the /etc system-wide one, then the home directory one
# profile and login are the same, just different times and to reflect behavior of other shells

# /etc /tmp and /var are all symlinks into /private/*
# In addition to hosts and shells, /private/etc/ contains files like:
# profile, bashrc, bashrc_${TERM_PROGRAM}, zshrc, zshrc_${TERM_PROGRAM}, and zprofile
# These are system-wide profiles!

# Note that zsh does not read /etc/profile or ~/.profile because it's not fully compatible with other shells' syntax
# It reads /etc/zprofile and ~/.zprofile instead

# Both /etc/profile and /etc/zprofile execute /usr/libexec/path_helper
# which reads the contents of file /etc/paths and of the files in /etc/paths.d
# and appends them to the PATH.
# /etc/paths has the basic starting locations
# /etc/paths.d contains files like `dotnet` and `mono-commands`

# .profile is not sourced in a new terminal window

# `sh` command re-executes as bash or zsh depending on /private/var/select/sh, which is a link to /bin/bash
# it loads /etc/profile and ~/.profile
# or rather it's supposed to, but that's not happening for the home one

# Okay, the problem is that path_helper is behaving as expected for Terminal.app BUT NOT FOR ITERM!!!
# Opened both Terminal and iTerm the next morning after a shut down and... both act the same now. -_-
# I had tried a computer restart last night to no avail.
